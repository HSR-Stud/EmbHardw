			\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\linewidth}|p{0.65\linewidth}|}
				\hline
				\textbf{Burst Mode}
					& Contiguous block is transferred in one. System bus and/or memory is solely reserved by the DMA.\\
				\hline
				\textbf{Cycle Stealing Mode}
					& Continually requesting and yielding control of the bus/resource. Causes the transfer to take longer in general.\\
				\hline
				\textbf{Transparent Mode}
					& CPU never waits for the resource, and DMA only transfers when the CPU doesn't need the bus.\\
				\hline	
				\textbf{Flyby Mode}
					& Transfers data in one cycle rather than the read/write cycle. Isn't supported by many controllers.\\
